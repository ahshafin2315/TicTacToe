# TicTacToe
A basic TicTacToe game in a python script 🐸.

Playable as a console based display game in any platform. 💻

Requires python binaries installed and executable in command-line. 🖥️

Game was made as a very small project for an undergrad course. 🏫

**Note:**
This is an improved game version.

1. Implemented numpy array for board representation
2. Simplified winner checking logic using numpy operations
3. Added type hints for better code maintenance
4. Consolidated display constants
5. Improved input validation
6. Simplified game flow logic
7. Reduced code duplication
8. More efficient board state checking
9. Better separation of concerns
10. Cleaner console output

The new version maintains the same game mechanics but is more efficient and maintainable.
The numpy array operations make winner checking faster, and the code structure is more organized and easier to follow.

To use this version, make sure to install numpy:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

Download the .py file from the code section.
Enjoy! 😃
